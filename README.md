# ism2411-data-cleaning-copilot

This repository is my submission for the portfolio project of course ISM2411. The structure follows the assignment prompt, with branches leading to data, src, the README and reflection text files.

The data branch leads to raw and processed data, the src branch leands to data_cleaning.py which is the main code of the assignment, made using the copilot extension on visual studio code.

The reflection file looks back on how I've approached the project and what I've learned during the process.
